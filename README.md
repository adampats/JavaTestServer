## JavaTestServer

A chump java server for testing socket connections, Java AMIs, ELBs - now with logging.  An afternoon project.

### How it works

Just run it, like so (make sure the JavaTestServer.jar file is present):

```sh
java -jar JavaTestServer.jar
```

To compile / create the jar file, use the `Makefile`:

```sh
make jar
```
